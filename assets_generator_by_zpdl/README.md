Provides [Dart Build System] builders for handling assets.

The builders generate code when they find members annotated with classes defined in [package:assets_annotation_by_zpdl].
Generates assets in pubspec.yaml

- To generate assets `pubspec.yaml` in for a class, annotate it with `@AssetsAnnotation`.
